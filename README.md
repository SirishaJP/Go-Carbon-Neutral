# **PROJECT: GO-CARBON-NEUTRAL** 

# Description
This project aims to raise local awareness about global warming by encouraging individuals, governments, and organizations to be socially responsible and to provide an answer to the most important question of all: What is our environmental footprint?

Greta Thunberg's most empowering quote, "Our relationship with nature is broken," emphasizes the importance of stepping outside of our comfort zone to save our planet. According to the 'IEA analysis,' global CO2 emissions will rise by 300 million tons in 2022, representing a 6% increase over 2021. In 2019, the agriculture sector in Germany was responsible for 56.1 million tons of CO2 emissions.

This equates to 7.7% of Germany's total greenhouse gas emissions. If we continue to live the same way, by 2050 the world is expected to have warmer temperatures, acidic oceans, and higher sea levels, making it extremely difficult for life to survive on Earth. The time for change has arrived.

The project's motivation is to **Think Globally, Act Locally!**

This project assists you in calculating your environmental footprint by converting your activity data to CO2 estimates, allowing you to understand your environmental impact and also suggesting activities to manage and reduce CO2 emissions.

The aim is to better understand CO2 emission estimates in the world. 

# Getting Started

## Requirement 

* Python 3.7 or higher 

### Download

To Install python of a specific version, In the terminal :

          pip install python == 3.9 

If you want to check for your Python Version 

          python -- version


## Set up 


1.  Generate API

     Create a unique [API Key](https://www.climatiq.io/docs/guides/getting-api-key) by following the steps below: 

    * Create an account https://auth.climatiq.io/
    * Sign In with your account credentials
    * Create API Key
    * A unique auto-generated API Key is successfully generated! 

3.  API Configuration 

It's always a best practice to store APIKey in a separate file to preserve confidentiality. An apiKey has no expiration date unless the APIkey is regenerated by the owner therefore, sharing APIkey is restricted. 

 By following the standard guidelines, a sample Python code file named 'sampleconfig.py' is provided for your reference  Given below are a few instructions to prepare your config.py file : 

 Make changes in the file 'sampleconfig.py' : 

* API request is a dictionary with string key-value as baseUrl and apiKey  

* Copy the base URL from the website's front page. Visit [Climatiq](https://www.climatiq.io/docs) and paste it as value for the key "baseUrl"

* From the API Generation step, copy the autogenerated API Key and paste it as value for the key "apiKey"

* Do not forget to rename the file sampleconfig.py as config.py

4. Run the Python file main.py in terminal

5. Log.txt contains data on a list of activities in the Agriculture/Hunting/Forestry/Fishing sector and their corresponding total co2 estimates.

# Error 

HTTP Response Codes to indicate the success or failure of API Request

**Status Codes **
| Status Code  |  Description | 
| :---:   | :---: | 
|200| OK: Everything worked as expected.|
|400| Bad Request: The request was unacceptable, probably due to missing a required parameter.|
|401| Unauthorized: No valid API key was provided.|
|404| Not Found: The requested resource doesn't exist.|
|5xx| Server Errors: Something went wrong on our servers.|

# About Data   

* [Climatiq. io](https://www.climatiq.io/) contains data from multiple sources from around the globe, spanning various sectors, regions, and years. The task is to create a class or classes in Python to query the Climatiq API and collect the data. 

* This project focuses on calculating CO2 emission per sector (i.e., Agriculture/Hunting/Forestry/Fishing) in the region 'Of Germany'. As a result, we could conclude upon the sector's contribution to Co2 emission and analyze finding alternatives for those activities to reduce co2 emission and bring a positive outlook for natural resources & consumption.

# Documentation 

Python is the most preferred programming language in the field of Data Science to leverage the use of libraries to collect data and gather interesting insights from various data sources. On working with multiple projects in Master with Python, I was familiarised with various packages. My internship experience as Data Engineer helped me gain hands-on experience to apply my knowledge in business to collect data, data transformations, and analysis using Machine learning algorithms and visualization libraries and tools (i.e., PowerBI). 

I taught myself using many sources to learn and implement unit testing. In the case of a big project and code base, testing helps debug our own code and also prevents breaking the flow of the whole code and the project.

The key advantages of Unit testing include:

* Detecting problems early
* Mitigating change 
* Simplify integration
* Source of Documentation 

which remains a primary element in improving the readability and scalability of complex projects during collaboration. 

# In the Code
For the purpose of this task, there are two different API calls one using GET and the using POST methods. 
The GET method fetches the list of emission factors based on the query parameters provided
The POST method calculates the total estimated emissions produced for a particular activity.

Sample inputs have been provided in the main file and outputs are logged as mentioned. 

The test case has been written for the GET method for its success case scenario.
